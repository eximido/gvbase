spikes from the ceiling caused damage
getting the chance to learn some new dance moves
Not noticing the trap
and fell right into a backup trap
gets a blow to the head
causing the whole team to inhale
receives a decent wound
sharp blades pop out of the walls
falling down into a pit with spears
stumbles and rolls head over heels
spears rising from the floor caused damage
triggered a trap that unbalanced a huge boulder
summoning a horde of .* to attack the feet
rewarded the heroes with a few new bruises
skillfully avoids a well-hidden trap
stepped on a stone which activated a trap
tortures all the adventurers
crushing everyone with its horrendous weight
dark cultists hate it to death when strangers show
walls slowly began to converge, giving the guests a big hug
disappeared through a trapdoor
dark sphere hovering near the ceiling gently tingles
got a slab with a concrete plate
just a really shiny ball of fire
The ceiling starts to descend slowly
bombarded them with their rock fruits
dark sphere hovering near the ceiling
the stone monkeys
With glazed eyes they shuffle forward
squarely in the face
gets a hammer on h.. head and loses
shouted before falling into a spear pit
causing damage to the whole team
hanging from the ceiling with all h.. might and got an artifact on h.. head
Iron maidens warmly hug the unlucky
others come closer to watch it go off
gets a hammer (on|to) h.. head and loses
dragging them toward a blossoming, hungry[- ]looking plant
itching to get through this thicket of poison
